                <p>A force of nature. Neither good nor evil, I am simply a product of the ever-shifting world we live in. But in my wake, lives have been upended, communities shaken. This is my story—and theirs.”</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>At least 223 people have died and hundreds are unaccounted for in the destruction wrought by Hurricane Helene since it made landfall in Florida on Sept. 26.</li>
                    <li>More than a week later, some residents and communities remain isolated, hundreds of thousands are without power, and spotty service has made communication difficult.</li>
