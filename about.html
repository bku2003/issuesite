                <h2>A Storm Unleashed</h2>
                <p>In 2024, Hurricane Helene tore through the southern coast, leaving behind not only physical destruction but emotional scars that will take years to heal. This site takes you on a journey to understand the storm, its power, and its consequences. Through a unique first-person narrative, I, Helene, will guide you through my path of destruction—not to glorify, but to help you understand the forces of nature at work and the human stories left behind.</p>

                <h2></h2>

                <h2>Helene Speaks, But So Do the People</h2>
                <p>While Helene’s voice will walk you through her natural cycle—growing from a whisper of wind to a roaring force—you’ll also hear from those who stood in her path. Survivors, first responders, and scientists share their perspectives, helping you grasp the magnitude of the event. Through their stories, we honor resilience and mourn the losses.</p>
